Title: Convenience wrapper for 'drat' and 'devtools'
Version: 0.1.6
Authors@R: person("Peter", "Meissner", email = "retep.meissner@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Building packages with 'devtools' is easy. Publishing packages
    with 'drat' is easy too. Combining both is two lines of
    code too much - hence 'dratful' - drat at it's fullest.
    The package aims at making the check-build-publish workflow a super easy
    one-liner - E.g. 'dratful::dratful()' will build, check, commit and push
    source and binary packages if all checks were passed any without error
    or warning. Use 'dratful::drat()' for leaving Git handling out.
